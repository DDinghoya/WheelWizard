## Antivirus Warning

### False Positive Detections

Some antivirus software, including Windows Defender, may incorrectly flag Wheel Wizard as a virus or trojan. 
This is a common issue with new software releases and is known as a "false positive." 
Rest assured, Wheel Wizard is safe to use.

### Why This Happens

- Antivirus programs sometimes mistakenly identify new or less common software as potentially harmful.
- These false detections can vary between different antivirus programs and even between scans.
- The inconsistency in these detections (e.g., being labeled as both a "virus" and a "trojan") further indicates that these are likely false positives.

### What You Can Do

1. **Ensure you're using the latest version** of Wheel Wizard, as we continually work to address these issues.
2. If you encounter a warning, you can submit the Wheel Wizard executable to Microsoft for analysis [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission). This helps improve detection accuracy.
3. You may need to add an exception for Wheel Wizard in your antivirus software to prevent it from interfering with the application.
4. If you dont trust us, you may either build the program yourself (we have included a build.bat in our source code)
5. Or you can run the program through [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and see it will pass 99% of checks
   
### What We're Doing About It

- We're actively working on submitting each release to Microsoft and other antivirus vendors for review.
- This process should help reduce false positive detections in future scans.
- We're exploring options for code signing, which may help prevent these issues in the long term.

### Trust and Verification

We understand that security is paramount when downloading software. We encourage users to:

- Verify that you're downloading Wheel Wizard from our official GitHub repository.
