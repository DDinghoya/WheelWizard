## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard, our mod manager, is created for the sole purpose of convenience. Technically, these mods and Retro Rewind are all doable without this app, but this app makes it possible with just a few clicks. It still has a lot of features in the planning stage and is fully in development, so keep an eye out for updates.

## How to Prevent Windows Defender from Detecting a False Positive .exe

If Windows Defender is detecting Wheel Wizard as a threat, you can add it to the exclusion list. Follow these super easy steps:

### Step 1: Open Windows Security

1. **Press** the **Windows Key**.
2. **Type** "Virus & threat protection" and **click** on it when it appears.

### Step 2: Manage Settings

1. Under "Virus & threat protection settings", **click** on "Manage settings".

### Step 3: Add an Exclusion

1. Scroll down to the "Exclusions" section and **click** on "Add or remove exclusions".
2. **Click** on "Add an exclusion" and select "File".

### Step 4: Select Your .exe File

1. **Browse** to the location of your .exe file.
2. **Select** the .exe file and **click** "Open".

Your .exe file is now excluded from Windows Defender scans and should no longer be detected as a false positive.

### Important Note:
We are in contact with Microsoft to resolve this issue. If you encounter any problems, please let us know.

## Antivirus Warning

### False Positive Detections

Some antivirus software, including Windows Defender, may incorrectly flag Wheel Wizard as a virus or trojan. 
This is a common issue with new software releases and is known as a "false positive." 
Rest assured, Wheel Wizard is safe to use.

### Why This Happens

- Antivirus programs sometimes mistakenly identify new or less common software as potentially harmful.
- These false detections can vary between different antivirus programs and even between scans.
- The inconsistency in these detections (e.g., being labeled as both a "virus" and a "trojan") further indicates that these are likely false positives.

### What You Can Do

1. **Ensure you're using the latest version** of Wheel Wizard, as we continually work to address these issues.
2. If you encounter a warning, you can submit the Wheel Wizard executable to Microsoft for analysis [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission). This helps improve detection accuracy.
3. You may need to add an exception for Wheel Wizard in your antivirus software to prevent it from interfering with the application.
4. If you dont trust us, you may either build the program yourself (we have included a build.bat in our source code)
5. Or you can run the program through [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) and see it will pass 99% of checks
   
### What We're Doing About It

- We're actively working on submitting each release to Microsoft and other antivirus vendors for review.
- This process should help reduce false positive detections in future scans.
- We're exploring options for code signing, which may help prevent these issues in the long term.

### Trust and Verification

We understand that security is paramount when downloading software. We encourage users to:

- Verify that you're downloading Wheel Wizard from our official GitHub repository.
- Check the code yourself if you have concerns â€“ we're open source for a reason!
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/vZ7T2wJnsq) if you have any questions or concerns.

Remember, while we assure you of our software's safety, it's always good practice to exercise caution when downloading and running new applications.
